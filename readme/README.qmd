[![Build Status](https://github.com/jolars/SLOPE.jl/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jolars/SLOPE.jl/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

SLOPE is a Julia package for fitting the Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation
(SLOPE) model, which is a regularization technique for generalized linear
models that induces both sparsity and clustering in the coefficients.

## Installation

You can install the package using the Julia package manager:

```{julia}
#| eval: false
using Pkg
Pkg.add("SLOPE")
```

You can also install the latest development version directly from GitHub:

```{julia}
#| eval: false
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/jolars/SLOPE.jl")
```

## Getting Started

```{julia}
using SLOPE
using Random
using LinearAlgebra

Random.seed!(58)

n = 1000
p = 8

x = rand(n, p)
β = [-3.0, 1.5, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

y = x * β .+ randn(n)

res = slope(x, y)
```

You can then plot the results:

```{julia}
using Plots

plot(res)
```

## Contributing

This package is a thin wrapper around [libslope](https://github.com/jolars/libsllpe),
which is a C++ library for fitting SLOPE models. So if you want to contribute to this
package, chances are that you will need to make the contribution in the C++ library.

When writing commit messages, please use the [conventional commits
format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Versioning

SLOPE uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).
